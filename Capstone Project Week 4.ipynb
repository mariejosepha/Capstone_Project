Moreover, different parts of the city tend to have different crime rates. Aiming to move to London in the next year, I want to explore safe boroughs to decide where I should live. \n\nBusiness Problem\n\nTo find out which boroughs are the safest, statistics and machine learning tools can be adopted to make informed decisions. As a result, the business problem we are currently posing is: where are the safest boroughs in the UK?\n\nTo solve this business problem, we are going to cluster London boroughs, based on both the crime rate in each borough as well as on nearby venues, so we can recomment boroughs that have a low crime rate and that have profitable venues nearby such as elementary schools, high schools, hospitals & grocery stores.\n"
